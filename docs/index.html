                        The purpose of this project is to use publicly available data through Spotify's
                        <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/">API</a>, the
                        <a href="https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Spotipy</a> python library, and audio
                        features
                        in the <a href="https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/">Million Song Dataset</a> (MSD) to
                        predict the success of Spotify user playlists, and create a tool to build successful playlists
                        based on user specified features (genre, artist, etc.).

                    <p>
                        Throughout this project "playlist success" (our response variable) is defined as the number of
                        playlist followers. We have employed machine-learning regression techniques taught throughout
                        the semester as well as
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">Word2vec</a> modeling to predict playlist

                        Baseline data was collected primarily from two sources - the Spotify Web API and the MSD. After
                        sourcing the Spotify users who “own” (the playlists are attached to their accounts) a large
                        number of playlists, the spotipy library was employed to collect user playlists, tracks, user
                        followers, and genre data from the API, each saved as JSON files. Genre information for
                        each playlist was harder to source and incorporate than one would think. It does not come
                        directly from each playlist, but rather from the artists of each track as a separate query. We
                        also collected celebrity names from <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/a/">US
                            Magazine</a> to determine if usernames corresponded to recognized celebrities. Before
                        combining into one comprehensive DataFrame, the separate files have the following basic form:

                        and artist name attributes. While cleaning, we decided to eliminate any playlist with only one
                        follower (the owner).

                        below):</b>
                        Given your new
                        target of predicting playlist success I suggest you make two notes in the final deliverable. (1)
                        your data collection method is novel, let's
                        highlight that and draw it out a bit for the final. You should give a description of how you get
                        these users and why you chose them? You say the users "own a large number of playlists" but this
                        isn't clear from the statistics quoted (see first point under Q1). (2) This is clearly a biased
                        subsample of data. But that's okay. We can make a comment about how we are looking at playlists
                        that have certain properties (i.e. more than x followers etc) as these are the interesting ones
                        for predicting popularity. Explicitly state that this will not generalise to seriously not
                        popular playlists though (which might have 0 followers). Why are there fewer playlists than
                        users (who supposedly create playlists)? This doesn't really make much sense to me. Does each
                        user really only have less than one playlist on average?How many playlists in that final
                        dataframe? How much data did you need to drop in doing the table joins?</p>

                        Engineering features around artist and playlist data yielded interesting relationships. A
                        cursory measure of playlist success, our generalized project goal, is the number of followers
                        per playlist. The distribution of playlist followers shows a significant right-skew, with most
                        playlists having few followers and a few approaching the 1M mark. The log-transform of followers
                        illustrates a potentially more useful response variable (right).

                        We further aggregated the artists by splitting them up into five distinct categories using
                        combinations of their mean popularity (as determined by Spotify's popularity metric) and total
                        number of artist tracks as seen in the following table. These categories should be
                        self-descriptive, but the two plots below do a fantastic job of illustrating each in terms of
                        their thresholds and relationships. The artist popularity metric ties in with our expectations
                        because we see people like Post Malone, Camila Cabello, and Ed Sheeran in our superstar
                        category.

                        that, unsurprisingly, not only do most playlists incorporate popular artists (red/orange), but a
                        lot of them have the superstar artists’ best songs (the mostly red right side), as well as a
                        smattering of one-hit-wonders (blue in the middle) and a dense area of moderately popular songs
                        throughout (between 30 and 70 popularity). This relationship and playlist architecture should
                        be intuitive.

                        below):</b> - Good job on the log. It is interesting to note that there are those two modes that
                        almost look like they could be considered different clusters. Idea for a higher level model is
                        to maybe use a mixture model to try and capture that distribution?
                        - Love the definition of the artist categories. This is some cool application insight into what
                        the data might be saying.
                        - You might want to have a paragraph or two on the final project detailing exactly why you made
                        the decision thresholds where you did. I.e. is it to capture 20% of the data in each category?
                        - Length of description?? You have to be joking! That got me thinking though. What about using
                        key words that are found in the description? You can run a lasso / stepwise regression to find
                        the most predictive words (assuming some words appear in many descriptions) and use those
                        selected words as predictive at some level?
                        - I would have expected playlist age to be more correlated with followers.
                        - For the final project make sure you standardise the plot styles and types. I.e. why scatter
                        and then suddenly hexagon? Why cool_blue color theme but red/orange above...
                        - It could be my eyes but I honestly couldn't read the labels on the plots right at the bottom.
                        - Can you make sure to motivate to me what exactly you mean by playlist velocity when we meet? I
                        mean I get the idea by again we need to make sure you define this clearly and motivate why your
                        definition makes sense.</p>

                    <p><b>Word2vec on Playlist Names:</b><br>
                        In order to go beyond the scope of 109A and incorporate a method not discussed in class, we
                        decided to apply a word-to-vec (w2v) transform to as many applicable words as there are in
                        the
                        set of playlist names. The core intuition being that the playlist name is what represents
                        the
                        playlist to the outside world. A bad playlist name can keep people from following or
                        listening
                        to it, even if the tracks within are great.
                    </p>

                        Click <a href="https://github.com/ac209-project/ac209-project/tree/master/w2v">here</a> to
                        explore the w2v model training and implentation specific to our project.

                        <b>Techique:</b><br>
                        By using word-to-vec we seek to cluster the playlist names into meaningful categories based
                        on
                        the sum of
                        the vectors of known words in each playlist. This implicitly seperates playlists with longer
                        (presumably more informative) names by giving them a total higher magnitude in the
                        100-dimensional space of our w2v transform, but seems to be a good aggregation
                        technique.

                        <b>Difficulties:</b><br>
                        Ultimately, there will be some difficulties with misspellings, different languages, and
                        internet
                        slang, and we will doubtless lose information in this quick application of w2v, but we
                        think the output will still be a meaningful feature in our final model.
