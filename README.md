# Spotify Playlist Analysis

### Next Deliverable
**Tues, Nov 28: EDA and Revised Project Statement (15 points)**
Submit a 2 - 3 page revised project statement and EDA to Canvas. Your submission should
include:
- A description of the data: what type of data are you dealing with? What methods have
you used to explore the data (initial explorations, data cleaning and reconciliation, etc)?
- Visualizations and captions that summarize the noteworthy findings of the EDA.
- A revised project question based on the insights you gained through EDA.

### High-level project goals
1. Derive a model that can predict Playlist success using only Spotify-provided predictors.
2. Combine features from other datasets such as Wikipedia, Million Song Dataset, and other external datasets, in hopes of reaching an improvement in predictive quality.
3. Use this improved model to generate new Playlists according to a user-specified genre or other search filters, and present these as potential ideas for implementation at Spotify.
