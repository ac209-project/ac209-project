# Spotify Playlist Analysis

### Next Deliverable
**Fri, Nov 17: Scope of Work**
Submit the Scope ofWork form on Canvas. The Scope ofWork form will prompt you for the following information: 
- Project statement. The project goal in the posted project description is not fully formulated or tuned. Based on the project description and references, state a well-defined question that youâ€™ll address in the project. 
- Preliminary EDA. Explain your plans for preliminary data exploration. Please take care when specifying your plans, so that team members can work individually on these tasks over the Thanksgiving week, and regroup the week after to finish the third milestone below.

### High-level project goals
1. Derive a model that can predict Playlist success using only Spotify-provided predictors.
2. Combine features from other datasets such as Wikipedia, Million Song Dataset, and other external datasets, in hopes of reaching an improvement in predictive quality.
3. Use this improved model to generate new Playlists according to a user-specified genre or other search filters, and present these as potential ideas for implementation at Spotify.
