# Spotify Playlist Analysis

### Next Deliverable
**Thurs, Dec 7: Project due (80 points)**
Submit your final project on Canvas. Your submission includes
- Jupyter notebook with relevant code (30 points), and
- Report presented on a website (45 points = 40 points content + 5 points for style).
- A peer evaluation of each team member (5 points)
A template for the report will be posted on Canvas, and the last lab will be devoted to
presentations on websites.

### High-level project goals
1. Derive a model that can predict Playlist success using only Spotify-provided predictors.
2. Combine features from other datasets such as Wikipedia, Million Song Dataset, and other external datasets, in hopes of reaching an improvement in predictive quality.
3. Use this improved model to generate new Playlists according to a user-specified genre or other search filters, and present these as potential ideas for implementation at Spotify.
